# Endorsement App

This project was more so to solidify the skills I learned in my last project (the Add to Cart App). 
Using Firebase to store and manipulate Realtime data is still new to me but I feel I was able to get
a better grasp of how to use this and incorporate this tool into my projects.

I come from a sales background so this was a nice app to make because endorsements/reviews play a part 
in helping you to gain more traction and leads. Most people like to see what someone elses experience with
a person or product is before commiting to anything themselves.

Please feel free to take a look at the live app with the following link: https://stalwart-pastelito-42c1f3.netlify.app/
